                <p>Vendor selection for destination weddings focuses primarily on officiant (denominational or non-denominational), photographer, florist, and music.

Please note that some venues require a wedding planner, and will provide you a selection for that as well.</p>

                <h2>Invitations</h2>
                <p>To complete the event, sending Save the Date and Wedding Invitations ahead of time, to allow guests plenty of time to research options for flights, hotels, car rental, is highly recommended. A modern approach to RSVP is to include a QR code on the invitation, to cut down on tiem for responses and collect all the responses in a central location. For destination weddings, most vendors will need a confirmation of guest count up to 4-6 months in advance.</p>

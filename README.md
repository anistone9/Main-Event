# Destination Wedding Planning

## Description

This first application, part of the portfolio, was created using only HTML and CSS. It focuses on learning and taking further the knowledge obtained for margins, padding, formatting content including background images, and navigation menus with hover contrast.

Additional information and images will be added to each section, as well as a contact information box for users to submit questions.

## Features

The application is still in its first stage, and needs additional support for formatting, and making it more user-friendly. It also needs media query screen added to the css file, and more styling. The page in its current state provides an introduction to the services that will be offered once finalized. Currently the page uses basic CSS selectors, properties and values, and focuses more on learning and retaining lessons learned.
